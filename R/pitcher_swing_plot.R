#'@title Pitcher Swing and Miss Plot
#'
#'@description Provides a plot of similar pitches as the one inputted
#'
#'
#'@param pitchtype The type of pitch thrown (fastball, slider, etc.)
#'@param relspeed The velocity of the pitch when it leaves the pitcher's hand in mph
#'@param spinrate The rate at which the ball is spinning in rpm
#'@param tilt The axis on which the ball spins, measured like hours and minutes on a clock, rounded to the nearest 15 minutes
#'@param inducedvertbreak The vertical difference in inches between where the ball is at home plate compared to where it would have been had it been affected by gravity alone
#'@param data A data frame corresponding to the data set
#'
#'
#'@return Returns a plot with pitches in the given training set that are within one standard deviation for each of the metrics listed, colored by the corresponding exit velocity
