#' @title pitcher_swing_predictions
#'
#' @description Predicts the probability of a pitch resulting in a swing and miss based on four key pitch design metrics.
#'
#' @param PitchType The type of pitch thrown (fastball, slider, etc.)
#' @param RelSpeed The velocity of the pitch when it leaves the pitcher's hand in mph
#' @param SpinRate The rate at which the ball is spinning in rpm
#' @param Tilt The axis on which the ball spins, measured like hours and minutes on a clock, rounded to the nearest 15 minutes
#' @param InducedVertBreak The vertical difference in inches between where the ball is at home plate compared to where it would have been had it been affected by gravity alone
#' @param data A data frame corresponding to the data set
#'
#' @return Returns a tibble with the predicted probability for a swing and miss
