# TrackMan
Initially created a golf tracking technology, the TrackMan system has become ubiquitous across the highest levels of baseball. Major League Baseball has implemented TrackMan as part of its Statcast package and the metrics it provides have increasingly become a significant talking point in its TV broadcasts. With respect to college baseball, the vast majority of Power 5 schools have invested in the technology, using it either as a tool for recruitment or performance enhancement. The sudden increase in the popularity of TrackMan has brought a swath of data that is still being investigated. In our brief experience in examining the data, we believe that the effectiveness of a pitch can largely be reduced to its velocity, spin rate, tilt, and induced vertical break. Spin rate and tilt describe, respectively, the rate in rpm and axis, measured like the hands on a clock, on which the ball spins.  Induced vertical break describes the vertical difference in inches between where the ball crosses home plate and where it would have crossed if gravity alone acted on the ball.
